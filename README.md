# Akaei Boombox

This is a Discord music bot for personal use only. It is not public and therefore there is no invite link for it. Sorry!
You may host it yourself if you'd like, though I'd appreciate if the Akaei art and name weren't used. Thanks!

This bot was pretty much entirely build using the [discord-player](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord-player) module. It is very good and useful and you should check it out.

Also this bot was made in like a day so the code is probably sloppy and silly. Sorry! Again! It's currently nearly 3AM please help.
